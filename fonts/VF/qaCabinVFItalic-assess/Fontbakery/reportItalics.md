<summary><b>[12] CabinItalicVF-v3001.ttf</b></summary>
<details>
<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Checking file is named canonically.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/canonical_filename](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/canonical_filename)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s filename must be composed in the following manner:
&lt;familyname&gt;-&lt;stylename&gt;.ttf

- Nunito-Regular.ttf,
- Oswald-BoldItalic.ttf

Variable fonts must list the axis tags in alphabetical order in square brackets
and separated by commas:

- Roboto[wdth,wght].ttf
- Familyname-Italic[wght].ttf


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** The file 'CabinItalicVF-v3001.ttf' must be renamed to 'Cabin[WIDT,wght].ttf' according to the Google Fonts naming policy for variable fonts. [code: bad-varfont-filename]

</details>
<details>
<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Is the Grid-fitting and Scan-conversion Procedure ('gasp') table set to optimize rendering?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/gasp](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/gasp)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Traditionally version 0 &#x27;gasp&#x27; tables were set so that font sizes below 8 ppem
had no grid fitting but did have antialiasing. From 9-16 ppem, just grid
fitting. And fonts above 17ppem had both antialiasing and grid fitting toggled
on. The use of accelerated graphics cards and higher resolution screens make
this approach obsolete. Microsoft&#x27;s DirectWrite pushed this even further with
much improved rendering built into the OS and apps.

In this scenario it makes sense to simply toggle all 4 flags ON for all font
sizes.


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** Font is missing the 'gasp' table. Try exporting the font with autohinting enabled.
If you are dealing with an unhinted font, it can be fixed by running the fonts through the command 'gftools fix-nonhinting'
GFTools is available at https://pypi.org/project/gftools/ [code: lacks-gasp]

<details>
<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Check name table: FONT_SUBFAMILY_NAME entries.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/subfamilyname](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/subfamilyname)

* 🔥 **FAIL** SUBFAMILY_NAME for Mac "Regular" must be "Italic" [code: bad-familyname]
* 🔥 **FAIL** SUBFAMILY_NAME for Win "Regular" must be "Italic" [code: bad-familyname]

</details>
<details>
<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Check that variable fonts have an HVAR table.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/varfont/has_HVAR](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/varfont/has_HVAR)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Not having a HVAR table can lead to costly text-layout operations on some
platforms, which we want to avoid.

So, all variable fonts on the Google Fonts collection should have an HVAR with
valid values.

More info on the HVAR table can be found at:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec
/otvaroverview#variation-data-tables-and-miscellaneous-requirements


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** All variable fonts on the Google Fonts collection must have a properly set HVAR table in order to avoid costly text-layout operations on certain platforms. [code: lacks-HVAR]

<details>
<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Font enables smart dropout control in "prep" table instructions?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/smart_dropout](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/smart_dropout)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

This setup is meant to ensure consistent rendering quality for fonts across all
devices (with different rendering/hinting capabilities).

Below is the snippet of instructions we expect to see in the fonts:
B8 01 FF    PUSHW 0x01FF
85          SCANCTRL (unconditinally turn on
                      dropout control mode)
B0 04       PUSHB 0x04
8D          SCANTYPE (enable smart dropout control)

&quot;Smart dropout control&quot; means activating rules 1, 2 and 5:
Rule 1: If a pixel&#x27;s center falls within the glyph outline,
        that pixel is turned on.
Rule 2: If a contour falls exactly on a pixel&#x27;s center,
        that pixel is turned on.
Rule 5: If a scan line between two adjacent pixel centers
        (either vertical or horizontal) is intersected
        by both an on-Transition contour and an off-Transition
        contour and neither of the pixels was already turned on
        by rules 1 and 2, turn on the pixel which is closer to
        the midpoint between the on-Transition contour and
        off-Transition contour. This is &quot;Smart&quot; dropout control.

For more detailed info (such as other rules not enabled in this snippet),
please refer to the TrueType Instruction Set documentation.


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** The 'prep' table does not contain TrueType instructions enabling smart dropout control. To fix, export the font with autohinting enabled, or run ttfautohint on the font, or run the `gftools fix-nonhinting` script. [code: lacks-smart-dropout]

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Variable font weight coordinates must be multiples of 100.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/varfont_weight_instances](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/varfont_weight_instances)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

The named instances on the weight axis of a variable font must have coordinates
that are multiples of 100 on the design space.


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** Found a variable font instance with 'wght'=95.0. This should instead be a multiple of 100. [code: bad-coordinate]
* 🔥 **FAIL** Found a variable font instance with 'wght'=106.0. This should instead be a multiple of 100. [code: bad-coordinate]
* 🔥 **FAIL** Found a variable font instance with 'wght'=118.0. This should instead be a multiple of 100. [code: bad-coordinate]
* 🔥 **FAIL** Found a variable font instance with 'wght'=128.0. This should instead be a multiple of 100. [code: bad-coordinate]
* 🔥 **FAIL** Found a variable font instance with 'wght'=95.0. This should instead be a multiple of 100. [code: bad-coordinate]
* 🔥 **FAIL** Found a variable font instance with 'wght'=109.0. This should instead be a multiple of 100. [code: bad-coordinate]
* 🔥 **FAIL** Found a variable font instance with 'wght'=116.0. This should instead be a multiple of 100. [code: bad-coordinate]
* 🔥 **FAIL** Found a variable font instance with 'wght'=128.0. This should instead be a multiple of 100. [code: bad-coordinate]

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Check correctness of STAT table strings </summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/STAT_strings](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/STAT_strings)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

On the STAT table, the &quot;Italic&quot; keyword must not be used on AxisValues for
variation axes other than &#x27;ital&#x27;.


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** The following AxisValue entries on the STAT table should not contain "Italic":
 ['Italic'] [code: bad-italic]

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Checking OS/2 achVendID.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Microsoft keeps a list of font vendors and their respective contact info. This
list is updated regularly and is indexed by a 4-char &quot;Vendor ID&quot; which is
stored in the achVendID field of the OS/2 table.

Registering your ID is not mandatory, but it is a good practice since some
applications may display the type designer / type foundry contact info on some
dialog and also because that info will be visible on Microsoft&#x27;s website:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/vendors/

This check verifies whether or not a given font&#x27;s vendor ID is registered in
that list or if it has some of the default values used by the most common font
editors.

Each new FontBakery release includes a cached copy of that list of vendor IDs.
If you registered recently, you&#x27;re safe to ignore warnings emitted by this
check, since your ID will soon be included in one of our upcoming releases.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** OS/2 VendorID value 'IMPA' is not yet recognized. If you registered it recently, then it's safe to ignore this warning message. Otherwise, you should set it to your own unique 4 character code, and register it with Microsoft at https://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/vendorlist.aspx
